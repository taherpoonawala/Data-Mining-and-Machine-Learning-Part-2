# Document Classification and Text Recognition using Deep Learning Methods
With the rising demand for system automation, manually categorizing and identifying images and text is a time-consuming task. Tasks such as document separation and routing to the proper department within the company, as well as user authentication, may be accomplished effortlessly using image classification and handwriting recognition technologies. For document image classification, models such as Sequential CNN and transfer learning models like VGG16 and ResNet are used. The VGG16 model performed well with an accuracy of 80\% and 60\% for train and test respectively. To recognize handwritten names in these documents, the CRNN model is used with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) function along with the ReLu activation function and Adam optimizer, accuracy of 73.17\% and 87.22\% in predicting the words and characters correctly respectively was achieved. Such high accuracy models aid in image classification and user validation, allowing an organization to decrease the overhead of manual tasks.
